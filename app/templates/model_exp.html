            In this study, we will be using deep learning algorithms in order to predict the water table depth using
            hydrological parameters like water diversion, precipitation, temperature, rainfall, etc and automating the
            process of finding the water table depth by providing the interface through which prediction can be made
            also the ability to
            Figure 3.1: flowchart of designing the model and selecting the best model based on the accuracy
            learn and improve the model by adding the functionality of updating or adding training data from the
            interface. In this study, we will be using the LSTM (long-short term memory) algorithm which is a special
            kind of RNN (recurrent neural network). An RNN model has internal self-looped cells, allowing the RNN to
            “remember” time-series information and making it adept at performing time-series tasks and will be using
            google colab for model implementation, model training, and finally model accuracy on RMSE, confusion matrix
            then finally deploying the model and linking it with the same sort of interface for easy access to everyone
            for the prediction and training the model over and over again for improving.
            After the training of the model with specified RNN algorithms with proper validation and checking the
            accuracy we will create a REST API which will serve the deployed trained model and act as bridge between
            client and prediction service which provides the prediction to the end user also a ML pipeline for
            continuous training/development and deployment of the model. The flow of contacting clients to prediction
            service and getting required prediction and other information through rest api is shown in the diagram (Fig
            3.2) below.
